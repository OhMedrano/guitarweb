10/10 - 
		
		Added a bunch of styling on to it. It looks good
		 Gotta add @media tags so I can have it more responsive for different devices.

		 Resolved issues:

		 Fixed an issue with the fret ratio selector not being clickable. 
		 Every option except "Show All" currently works.
		
		 (#1 For me later...)
		 May have a work around with that by calling the fretRest function inside of the controller.

		 (/For me later...)

		 Current issues:

		 1- Google Font API tag keeps disappearing after every git commit/grunt serve.

		 (#2 For me later...)
		 		<link href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Pacifico|Oxygen+Mono|Oxygen' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>

		 		Current css link tag
		 (/For me later...)

		 2- "Show All" selection is currently unclickable. 
		 		- Possible fix in "#1 For me later..."

		 3- Weird Margin/Padding on the nav menu li


		 In-Progress:
