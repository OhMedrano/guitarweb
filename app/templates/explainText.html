		<p>When you're playing a harmonic, any harmonic, you are actually playing a string at its perfect division. At its perfect ratio so to say.</p>

		<p>Take for example the natural harmonics, the ones you play over the 12th fret. The area where you place your finger for that harmonic is actually the perfect / near perfect half of the whole string.</p>

		<p>You can use the same example for the 5th and 7th fret harmonics since they divide the string into 3rds and 4ths respectfully.</p>

		<p>We'll call these perfect divisions "Nodes". So if you're dividing a string in half, you'll have one node aka the natural harmonic on the 12th fret. By 3rds? The node will be on the 5th fret. You get the picture.</p>

		<p>Pinch harmonics works in a simliar way; instead of going the full string distance (Nut to Bridge), you'll be measuring from a variable distance (Finger to bridge) AND pluck that harmonic.</p>

		<p>For example, if you were on the placing your finger on the 9th fret, you'll be measuring the distance from your finger to the bridge; making the node for the HALF the length of the string around the area where the 20th fret is located.</p>
